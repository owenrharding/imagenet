Implemented 'process_command_line' function, which parses command line, does an initial validity check, and extracts relevant information.
Created a number of structs, including 'CommandLineArgs', 'IO', and 'Scale', which are all used in the processing of the command line.
Implemented 'str_to_int' function, which checks if a string is an integer or not.
Implemented 'throw_usage_error' function, which throws a usage error.

Added I/O File Checking - implemented with the function 'check_files', which attempts to open the input and output file names (if given) which should be provided in the command line.
Also added functions 'throw_read_error' and 'throw_write_error', which are errors to be thrown upon the respective inability to open a file for reading or writing.

Changed paths:
   M /trunk/a4/uqimageproc.c

Added server functionality. Server can now wait on a given port or run on an ephemeral port, create sockets, bind to sockets, listen for clients, and accept clients (without connection limiting/semaphores/race conditions implemented).
Added multi-threading functionaliy. Was not difficult to implement as it was copied pretty much straight from server-multithreaded.c from the lectures.
Also added functionality to construct and send HTTP responses. In a client thread, the program can use the get_HTTP_request function to identify what response should be sent back accordingly.
Functions 'init_headers_array' and 'send_response' make sending HTTP responses extremely modular when paired with the use of an 'init_(blank)_response' function, which initialises a 'Response' struct to be sent to the client.

Added operation execution (image manipulation) and '200' OK requests to go along with them.

Fixes with timeout issues on semaphore implementation. Originally was passing in a pointer to a struct contained in a struct, but now just putting the semaphore lock variable straight into the struct being passed into the client.

Added the start of mutually exclusive inter-thread statistics manipulation. This was done with the new sem_t lock which is initialised in main using the new 'init_lock' function.
Attributes of the new Statistics struct (which contains to pointers to statistics variables) is initialised in main, passed to process_connections, and the addresses of the variables in stats is then passed to each client thread created.
Semaphore-locked (race-condition safe) variable manipulation is implemented in the function 'change_sem_stat', and is called in the client_thread function.

Added operation success counting. Did this by modifying the 'execute_ops' function to return a new OpExecInfo struct. 'execute_ops' now counts whenever an operation succeeds and adds it to the count returned by it. The statistic is then updated in 'construct_response'.
